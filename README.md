# Project: Website Layout with Sass and Flexbox

## Project Goal

This project is designed to help you learn how to create structured and responsive websites using:
- **Sass** for more efficient and organized styling
- **CSS Flexbox** for flexible layout design that adapts to various screen sizes
- **BEM Methodology** for maintaining clean and scalable CSS code

## Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:
- **HTML** — for structuring the web page
- **Sass (SCSS)** — for styling, leveraging features like variables, mixins, and nesting
- **CSS Flexbox** — for building a responsive layout
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** — a methodology for organizing CSS code, making it more readable and maintainable

## Key Features

### 1. Using Sass
- **Variables**: Used for colors, fonts, and other values, making it easy to change styling in one place.
- **Mixins**: Created for reusable styles, such as font and color settings or media queries.
- **Nesting**: Ensures cleaner and more organized code, making it easier to read and maintain.

### 2. Using Flexbox
- The entire layout is structured with Flexbox, allowing easy control over the alignment and arrangement of elements. Flexbox is used to:
  - Center content
  - Align elements in rows or columns
  - Create responsive containers that adjust to screen size automatically

### 3. BEM Methodology
- Blocks, elements, and modifiers are clearly defined to avoid style conflicts and ensure predictable styling. This approach allows for easier maintenance and future expansion of the project.
